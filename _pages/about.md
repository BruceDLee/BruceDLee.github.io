I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), hosted by Andreas Krause, John Lygeros, and Melanie Zeilinger. My research focuses on developing reliable autonomous decision making agents that interact with the physical world, drawing on tools from robust control, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling.

Before joining ETH, I completed my PhD in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 2025, and my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 2020. During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of Nikolai Matni studying fundamental limits and efficient algorithms for learning-enabled control. My PhD was partially funded by a [NDSEG followship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/).
